How To Install AACGC Plugins:

All AACGC plugins folders are compressed into a .zip format.

Step 1: Once you download a plugin to your computer, right click and unzip the plugin folder onto your computer.
Step 2: Upload the unzipped folder to your e107_plugins directory on your website thru FTP.
Step 3: Go to your Plugin Manager in your e107 admin area and click Install next to the AACGC plugin uploaded.

IMPORTANT: You can NOT install AACGC plugins using the plugin manager upload form!

NOTE: Some AACGC Plugins automatically set best default settings when installed or updated, If a plugin does not automatically adjust the settings you must manually adjust
 them by clicking the plugin icon in your main admin area. If settings are not adjusted properly for some plugins some areas may not show or you may even recieve errors.
Please check your settings and adjust them to best fit your website. You can read more on adjusting plugin settings in the AACGC FAQs or plugin pages. If your updating a 
plugin that adds or removes features it may adjust your settings back to default and you will have to readjust your settings if this happens.
